# Next.js on Firebase App Hosting

This is a demo [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app powered by Firebase App Hosting.

## Service Infrastructure

Dynamic content is generated by server running on [Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/overview/what-is-cloud-run), a fully managed compute platform that automatically scales stateless containers.

Static assets are served by [Google Cloud CDN](https://cloud.google.com/cdn/docs/overview), a fast and secure way to host static content globally.
